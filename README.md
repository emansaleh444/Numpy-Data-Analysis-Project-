# Numpy-Data-Analysis-Project-
• In this project, we will use a really small data set, called 
Fisher's Iris dataset
• This data set was introduced by the British statistician and 
biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936.
• The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from each of the 
three species of the flower Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica
and Iris versicolor).
• Four features were measured for each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. 
• The headers are: “sepal length”, “sepal width”, “petal length”, “petal width”, “iris”, and “species No”.
